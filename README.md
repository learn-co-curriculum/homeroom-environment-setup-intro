# Resource: Environment Setup Instructions

The next two sections contain the lessons that walk through the environment
setup process for MacOS and Windows.

You should have set up your local environment when you were completing the
Prework, so this information is included here for your convenience.

If you do need to re-do your environment setup now or in the future (e.g., if
you get a new computer), you can easily access the most up-to-date instructions
here.
